# Wiimote-Wrapper-for-Unity
Allows the Wiimote to be used in older free versions of the Unity Game Engine that did not allow for importing dlls.

This code is a wrapper for WiimoteLib: https://wiimotelib.codeplex.com/ . It exposes the functionality by running an external localhost server that waits for requests from a client that is run from within Unity. This approach was needed as past versions of Unity also didn't allow for process message passing. 

This code was written for students of a gameplay programming university course so that they could work on assignments at home with free versions of Unity as well as the pro versions of Unity on campus.

This is an upload of a past project and is no longer maintained.
